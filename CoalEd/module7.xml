        <description>Beyond energy usage, coal is used in many products that we take for granted in our everyday lives.  Coal ash is a byproduct that can be used in making useful materials rather than generating more waste.

        <description>Not only do we use coal to generate electricity, we recycle coal byproducts to make new things.  For example, coal makes bowling balls more impact-resistant.</description>

            Coal Products
        
            Burning coal creates coal ash that is the byproduct of the burning process. One way
            to offset the impact of coal burning is to make use of the coal ash in other products.
            For example, for every ton of fly ash used in place of Portland cement (material
            used in making concrete) about a ton of carbon dioxide is prevented from entering
            earth's atmosphere?
            
            There are a variety of products made from coal ash that we use everyday:
            
            •   Asphalt for roads
            
            •   Fertilizers used in food production
            
            •   Synthetic rubber to manufacture tires
            
            •   Paints for homes and offices
            
            •   Explosives
            
            •   Baking powder
            
            •   Medicines
            
            •   Perfume
            
            •   Clothing buttons
            
            •   Billiard balls
            
            •   Drywall for construction
