        <description>Energy conservation is a critical part of the conversation about energy. Both on a large scale as well as individual consumers can make a difference in making energy use as efficient as possible.

        <description>90% of an incandescent light bulb's energy goes into heat produciton. A compact fluorescent light bulub (CFL) like the one shown above, is much more efficient.</description>

            Energy Use and Conservation
            
            One of the best ways to keep energy costs low and to maintain the inventory
            of current fossil fuel resources is to use energy more effectively with smart
            conservation in mind. On a larger, collective level, the government and energy
            companies need to take steps to encourage more conservation and to leverage all
            technical tools to make energy usage as efficient as possible. The implementation of
            a "smart grid" would help to make this possible
            
            On a personal level, we all have a responsibility to use energy resources wisely.
            What can you do? Turn EVERYTHING OFF when not in use; go LCD not plasma;
            efficient windows capture heat better and the list goes on and on.
