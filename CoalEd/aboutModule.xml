        <description>Welcome to Power UP!
            
    Energy impacts every area of our life, but often we donâ€™t think about where it comes from and how much we are using every day. Power UP takes a look at how we use energy, where it comes from and how we can use it more responsibly.
            
    In each of the seven modules, you will watch a short video that introduces key energy ideas. Look inside a power plant, learn how burnt coal ash can be used in concrete, and find out what algae has to do with keeping carbon out of the air.
            
    Share the videos with friends through our YouTube channel and download the mobile iPad Power UP app to take them along with you.
