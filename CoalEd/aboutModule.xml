            Welcome to Power UP!
            
            Energy impacts every area of our life, but often we donâ€™t think about where it comes 
            from and how much we are using every day. Power UP takes a look at how we use
            energy, where it comes from and how we can use it more responsibly.
            
            In each of the seven modules, you will watch a short video that introduces key
            energy ideas. You can also learn more about each topic in the info section. For even 
            more resources make sure to also check out our website: www.powerupky.org
            
            Power Up! was funded through a grant from the Kentucky Cabinet for Energy and
            Environment and produced by the Center for Applied Energy Research and Vis
            Center at the University of Kentucky.
