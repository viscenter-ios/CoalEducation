        <description>Water is our most vital natural resource and it is impacted every day by energy use. All energy sources are dependent upon water or impact water in some way.</description>

        <description>We need water for almost any form of energy production, not just for hydroelectric power.  In nuclear and coal-fired power plants, water cools the machinery.  Protecting our water from pollution is key.

            Water and Energy
            
            Most people think of heat and power when they think about energy, but did you
            know that almost all energy sources are dependent upon water or impact water in
            some way? Think about the impact on water supply from energy use:
            
            •   Water used in extraction, refining, processing and transporting
            
            •   Used directly in hydroelectric generation
            
            •   Used in cooling/emissions scrubbing in thermoelectric
            
            •   Thermoelectric uses almost as much water as electric
            
            •   When temperatures rise and people use more electricity for AC,
                hydroelectric dams use more water
