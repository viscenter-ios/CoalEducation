This app revolves around adding content via XML files. It should be fairly
obvious looking at the ones currently included, but there are some nuances.
These are as follows:

Each module must be listed in the modules.xml file. Beyond that file, they can
be named anything you want.
Each module file, as included in modules.xml, contains an id tag, a title tag,
and one or more content tags.
If there is only one content item, then there will be no content item buttons
displayed on the bottom of the page. If there are multiple, the button images
are described by the content's thumbnail tag.
Each content item can have ONE optional htmlFile tag. This tag displays the
aforementioned file in the top half of the module screen. If this tag is absent
then the whole screen is dedicated to the description.
